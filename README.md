# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-using-LSTMs
Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
In this project we will train LSTM based deep learning model for Recognizing Named Entity.
